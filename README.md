- 👋 Hi, I’m @SimPar28
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, animation, drawing, and voice acting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to live a satisfactory life.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that cater to my skill level (very low...self-esteem).
- 📫You may reach me on my email: simonemarieparn@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: They/them (Ew, a queer)
- ⚡ Fun fact: One day I will be the shortest person in my family.
